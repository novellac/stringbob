# stringbob
Yet another spongebob-themed sarcasm string manipulator

**This repository is archived and is out of date. If you want to use it, update all dependencies for security issues. But really, probably don't use it. It was a proof of concept I made for fun.**

## What is it?
It is an npm package.

## What does it do?
It takes in a string and (pseudo) randomly makes the letters uppercase or lowercase.

## But why tho?
It seemed like a fun way to build my first npm package.
